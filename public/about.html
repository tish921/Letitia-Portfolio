<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate and driven individual from South Africa with 22 years of experience in the medical field. Recently, I decided to persue a new path in technology by studying for a Full-Stack Developer. 
  My goal is to work remotely, allowing me to balance my careeraspirations with my commitment to my Beauty Salon and family.</p>
   

  <p>Opening my own Beauty Salon, Beauty Sculpt and Wellness Studio, 
  was a dream come true, and it's been an incredible journey to build a space 
where clients feel rejuvenated and confident. Now, I'm channeling that same dedication 
and determination into mastering Full-Stack development. I'm excited to combine my problem-solving skills and attention to 
detail with new technical expertise</p>

<p>I'm commited to continuous learning and growth in this field,
  and I'm eager to take on new challenges that will push me to 
  develop innovative solutions. Thank you for taking time to explore 
  my portfolio-I can't wait to connect and share more about my journey!</p>
